### Key Findings

- Worldwide, the most popular birth control methods are female sterilisation (30.1%), IUDs (21.5%) and the pill (13.9%). Male sterilisation, on the other hand, is a tiny fraction (3.7%).

- Family planning, or choosing if you want to have children, and when and how, is a right. But 12 of every 100 sexually active women aged 15 to 49 cannot exercise it.

- There are unmet needs in all kinds of countries, from the United States to Albania, but in the least developed countries, the rate is double the global average.
 
- The main barriers to contraceptive use are fear of [side effects](/contraceptives/data-use-barriers/#barriers) and opposition from women themselves and people in their communities. 

- Religion continues to be [a barrier to birth control](/contraceptives/religion/). It can interfere with a gynecological consultation in Israel, in a purchase in a pharmacy in Mexico or in an imam-supervised sex education class in Senegal. 

- The three main monotheistic religions permit contraceptives [in some cases](/contraceptives/religion/#permission-granted-sometimes-for-health-reasons), but a woman's freedom of choice comes second to [mens' interpretation of scripture](/contraceptives/religion/#whos-word-of-god).

- Women from around the world [tell us about](/contraceptives/testimonies-of-women/) the contraceptive methods they know, the ones they use and the factors that have shaped their choices.
