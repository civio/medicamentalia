### Key Findings

* [Pharmaceutical companies say they adjust their prices based on each country's income, but in many cases the poorer buyers end up paying more than richer ones.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [For the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib pentavalent vaccine, Ukraine (with a lower-middle income) pays Sanofi almost the same price as Spain (high income): more than €22 per dose. And this is just one example.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [Many countries hide the total amount paid or the number of doses purchased so as not to reveal what conditions they've agreed with pharmaceutical companies.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [Over half of the countries in the world have not given the first dose of the vaccination against measles to at least 95% of children, the percentage required to reach herd immunity.](/vaccines/immunization/ "Immunization - Medicamentalia")
* [Vaccination levels are not improving: global average immunization coverage has increased by only 1% since 2010.](/vaccines/immunization/ "Immunization - Medicamentalia")
* [Europe registered 26,000 measles cases in 2015 -far more than the 611 reported across the American continent- and seven of the ten countries with the lowest confidence level in vaccine are European.](/vaccines/antivacunas/ "Antivaccines - Medicamentalia")
* [Polio can be eradicated like smallpox was. In 2016, just 42 cases were registered worldwide, across only four countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Laos and Nigeria.](/vaccines/successes/ "Successes - Medicamentalia")
* [In 2015, 97 countries notified WHO shortages of essential vaccines. The failure of one of the few manufacturers of the antigen against tuberculosis shot that number up.](/vaccines/stockout/ "Stockout - Medicamentalia")
