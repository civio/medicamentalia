* [Pharmaceutical companies say they adjust their prices based on each country's income, but in many cases the poorer buyers end up paying more than richer ones.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [For the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib pentavalent vaccine, Ukraine (with a lower-middle income) pays Sanofi almost the same price as Spain (high income): more than â‚¬22 per dose. And this is just one example.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [Many countries hide the total amount paid or the number of doses purchased so as not to reveal what conditions they've agreed with pharmaceutical companies.](/vaccines/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [Over half of the countries in the world have not given the first dose of the vaccination against measles to at least 95% of children, the percentage required to reach herd immunity.](/vaccines/immunization/ "Immunization - Medicamentalia")
* [Vaccination levels are not improving: global average immunization coverage has increased by only 1% since 2010.](/vaccines/immunization/ "Immunization - Medicamentalia")
* [Europe registered 26,000 measles cases in 2015 -far more than the 611 reported across the American continent- and seven of the ten countries with the lowest confidence level in vaccine are European.](/vaccines/antivacunas/ "Antivaccines - Medicamentalia")
* [Polio can be eradicated like smallpox was. In 2016, just 42 cases were registered worldwide, across only four countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Laos and Nigeria.](/vaccines/successes/ "Successes - Medicamentalia")
* [In 2015, 97 countries notified WHO shortages of essential vaccines. The failure of one of the few manufacturers of the antigen against tuberculosis shot that number up.](/vaccines/stockout/ "Stockout - Medicamentalia")
* [The countries with the highest incidence and mortality from cervical cancer are the poorest, but the HPV vaccine is not included in most of their immunization programs due to its high cost.](/vaccines/hpv/ "HPV - Medicamentalia")
