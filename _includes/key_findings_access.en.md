### Key Findings

* [The differences in price of 14 drugs analysed in 61 countries are very pronounced **even when looking at generics**. And the variance is not compensated by salaries. This means that a citizen of a developing country has to work much harder to afford the same treatment.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/prices/ "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [In Nigeria or Congo, buying **a box of 30 omeprazole pills costs 13 days' wages, while it’s between one and two hours of wages in Spain, Germany and Italy**. The most expensive drug in all the countries analysed was **simvastatin** (almost five days' wages on average) against less than one hour’s for diazepam.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/prices/#viz "Prices - Medicamentalia")
* [In Ghana, we showed that there is a relationship between the high price of highly demanded essential medicines and their counterfeits, illegally imported from Asia.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/counterfeits/ "Counterfeits - Medicamentalia")
* [The costs of creating a new drug are **not transparent**. Studies supported by the pharmaceutical industry talk of 2.277 billion euros, while civil society organisations claim that 44 million euros are enough. It’s **impossible to have a facts-based debate with the current data**.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/patents/#the-cost-of-developing-a-new-drug "Patents - Medicamentalia")
* [A number of initiatives pushed forward by public and private organisations, such as as PDP, are looking for **alternative models to intellectual property**. Although the industry acknowledges the benefits of these procedures in some particular cases, it argues that **the patent system is non-negotiable**.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/patents/#alternatives "Patents - Medicamentalia")
* [The approval of compulsory licensing in Brazil in 2007 **didn’t make drug companies abandon the country, as was augured** by certain companies in the sector and even some governments such as the United States' one. Quite the opposite, both foreign investment and the number of patents have kept growing since then.](http://medicamentalia.org/access/compulsory-license/ "Compulsory License - Medicamentalia")
