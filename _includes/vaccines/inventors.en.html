        <h5>Edward Jenner</h5>
        <p>Inventor of the first vaccine. At a time when <strong>smallpox</strong> was a killer in Europe, Jenner observed that cows suffered a type of smallpox with wounds on their udders and that the milkmaids that became infected with this less serious type of bovine smallpox did not contract the disease in its human form.</p>

        <h5>Albert Calmette & Camille Guerin</h5>
        <p>In 1905 they began to research tubercle bacillus at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, until the outbreak of the First World War. In 1921 they discovered the vaccine against <strong>tuberculosis</strong>, which had taken the lives of Guerin's wife and father.</p>

        <h5>Jonas Salk</h5>
        <p>In 1955, having tested the <strong>polio</strong> vaccine in a group of volunteers, including his family, the antigen was proven to be safe. Salk refused to exploit his discovery financially and did not patent the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Responsible for the development of over 40 antigens for the pharmaceutical company Merck. In 1963, his daughter contracted <strong>mumps</strong> and Hilleman took a sample. After four years cultivating the virus, he discovered the vaccine.</p>
