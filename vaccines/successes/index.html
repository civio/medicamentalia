He has spent years in this “business”, as he calls it and with the memory of how <strong>diseases that have been practically eradicated today could decimate entire generations just a few years ago</strong>, he is worried by the lack of confidence in vaccines amongst certain segments of the population. “A mistake in this field could destroy the past hundred years of successes”. Since Edward Jenner used cowpox to create a vaccine against the smallpox and coined the word vaccine -from the Latin ‘vacca’ for cow-, in the late 18th century, there have been many such achievements.</p><div class="container-right"><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlhljqMpTBQ?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;hl=en&amp;cc_load_policy=1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p class="video-container-caption">Mario Martínez, from PAHO. | <strong>Vídeo: Manuel Penados.</strong></p></div><p>In 1980, nearly two centuries after Jenner’s experiments, <strong>smallpox was officially eradicated worldwide</strong>.

In 2016, just 42 cases of this disease were recorded worldwide, across just four countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Laos and Nigeria. Europe, America and the Pacific region have already been declared polio-free areas, a status which is only achieved after three consecutive years with no recorded cases of a disease.</p></div><div class="graph-container"><div id="video-map-polio-description"></div><div class="video-map-polio-container"><div id="video-map-polio" class="video-container"></div><div class="video-map-polio-cover"><div class="video-map-polio-title"><p>Discover how polio cases have decreased from 1980, almost disappearing.</p><a id="video-map-polio-play-btn" href="#">Play</a></div><img class="img-responsive" src="http://resources.civio.es/medicamentalia/medicamentalia/assets/images/articles/map-polio.png"></div></div></div><div class="page-content-container"><figure style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-77" src="http://resources.civio.es/medicamentalia/medicamentalia/assets/images/articles/polio.jpg" alt="Room with so-called 'iron lungs' for serious cases of polio.}" width="460" height="343"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Room with so-called 'iron lungs' for serious cases of polio.<strong> | Polio Eradication</strong></figcaption></figure><p>This is an impetus for humanity (if it keeps its guard up) to literally wipe off the face of the earth a disease that mainly affects children and, in the early 20th century, terrorised the population. The virus causes fever, fatigue, migraines, nausea and pain and stiffness in the limbs. In some cases, it can cause paralysis and develop into deformities, an image that remains etched in the minds of those that lived with it. Another infamous image is that of the so-called <strong>iron lungs</strong>, metal chambers that were used to treat the most serious cases of polio, cases in which paralysis had affected the respiratory system of the patient to the point where it could no longer function unaided. Each patient was contained within an airtight chamber, with only their head and neck outside. By means of what was called <strong>negative pressure</strong>, the lungs of the patient were allowed to inhale and exhale.</p><figure style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-77" src="http://resources.civio.es/medicamentalia/medicamentalia/assets/images/articles/jonas-salk.jpg" alt="Jonas Salk, on the cover of Time magazine in 1954.}" width="460" height="343"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jonas Salk, on the cover of Time magazine in 1954.<strong> | Polio Eradication</strong></figcaption></figure><p>In the context of this health crisis, Jonas Salk created the vaccine against the disease and renounced its patent. Just over 60 years ago, it began to be used. Shortly after, Albert Bruce Sabin developed the oral polio vaccine, the key to reaching millions of children worldwide, thanks to its ease of administration.</p><p>These are just two examples of the many men and women that have contributed, since the first inoculations, towards raising a preventative shield to tens of diseases.
