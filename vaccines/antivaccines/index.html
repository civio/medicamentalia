The resurgence of certain diseases that had been practically forgotten occurs, in the majority of cases, in marginalised communities that are not covered by basic services. Occasionally, the problem has nothing to do with the resources available: <strong>certain parents simply choose not to vaccinate their children despite the <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/84/es/" target="_blank">WHO recommendations</a></strong>.</p></div><div class="graph-container"><p class="graph-container-caption">Measles cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015</p><div id="measles-world-map-graph" class="map-graph"><div class="tooltip top" role="tooltip"><div class="tooltip-arrow"></div><div class="tooltip-inner"><p class="title"></p><p class="description"><strong class="value"></strong> cases<br>per 100,000 inhabitants<br>(<span class="cases"></span> cases)</p></div></div></div></div><div class="page-content-container"><p>Germany registered 2,464 measles cases in 2015, only exceeded in Europe by Kyrgyzstan. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/silicon-valley-daycares-still-big-vaccination-problems/" target="_blank">In Silicon Valley</a> new outbreaks are being recorded, along with vaccination rates below the required minimum, whilst the new President of the United States, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, has met with leaders of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-anti-vaxxer-20170116-story.html" target="_blank">anti-vaccine movements</a>.

The country is outperformed by over 100 countries, including Sri Lanka and Algeria for instance. France did not provide 2015 data to the WHO, however in 2014 the country’s immunization rate was 74%.

The initial fear of vaccines in rural areas (a fear of the unknown) <strong>has not transformed into true anti-vaccine sentiment</strong>, it remains anecdotal. Such communities have moved from “hiding their children” when vaccination campaigns arrived in their towns to “pushing their children to the front of the queue” for vaccines, according to Ademir Vásquez, from the Ministry of Health of Guatemala’s national immunization programme.</p><h3>How do we deal with this?</h3><div class="container-right"><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hSgScxpsWE?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;hl=en&amp;cc_load_policy=1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p class="video-container-caption">Mario Martínez, from PAHO. | <strong>Video: Manuel Penados.</strong></p></div><p>Every person interviewed for this article <strong>repeated the same word: education</strong>.

The director of the Ministry of Health’s immunization programme admits that, in practice, they would not deny an unvaccinated child their schooling, as this would create a barrier to another basic right - education.

In the past, they were linked to a fear of the new, the unknown. It has been this way since the first vaccine, created by Edward Jenner against smallpox. The fact that this immunization involved vaccination of a human with the bovine version of the disease surprised and alarmed many, who believed that the vaccine could cause shocking deformities. Nowadays, the anti-vaccine sentiment stems from a lack of confidence in institutions, pharmacists, organisations and even scientific evidence.</p></div></div><div class="container page-content"><div class="page-content-container"><div class="donate"><strong>Did you like this story?</strong><p>Help us to continue making necessary investigations like this donating to Civio</p><a class="btn btn-default" href="http://haztecomplice.civio.es/#hazte-complice" target="_blank" title="Donate">Donate</a></div></div><ul class="social-share"><li><a class="btn btn-social-icon btn-twitter" onclick="window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Medicamentalia.
