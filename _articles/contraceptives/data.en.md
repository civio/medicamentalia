Family planning is not a privilege, but a right. That's what Babatunde Osotimehin said when he was the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in 2012. It not only helps eradicate poverty, he said, but is also "one of the most effective means of empowering women". He died past July. International organisations, including the United Nations, have been [declaring](https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/EN_SWOP2012_Report.pdf) for decades that choosing if you want to have children and when and how to do it is a fundamental human right.

But it's a right that is undermined whenever a girl becomes pregnant, whenever a woman is accused of being promiscuous, or even prostitute, for using some form of birth control, every time she is forced to have unwanted children, every time she is forced to have abortions in unsanitary conditions, every time someone tells her what she must do or blocks her access, although she is the one who, in many countries, bears the consequences of that decision, every time that a new birth puts her health at risk or kills her. These are not made-up examples. They are true stories gathered in this investigation of how people exercise this universal right and what barriers women confront to do it.
Fanta Jatta knows more than most about these cases. She talks about it at the headquarters of Action Aid International, in Banjul, Gambia, where she directs the program on women's rights. For her, in addition to the health problems--for mothers and children--caused by a lack of access to contraceptives, there is something more fundamental: who decides and how. "We need to understand how our bodies work and make our own decisions," she says.

In The Gambia, many women use a traditional method with different names that is carried out in different ways. They share the same, unscientific, principle: the women tie a cord or a branch with or without words from the Koran on a slip of paper to their waists to try to prevent pregnancy. Of course it does not work.

They may want to space their pregnancies for health reasons or to stagger their child care or organise their own lives a certain way. "I started taking contraceptives after my first pregnancy, only seven months later I was pregnant again, so when I had my second child, I decided I did not want to go through the same situation again in my third pregnancy," says Jarra Joof, a 42-year-old member of her children´s school´s Mothers´ Club in Banjul, The Gambia.

Joof spaced our her subsequent pregnancies, for example, and now she is back to using birth control. "Seven is enough," Joof says. 

Some women may not want to have any children at all or simply not want more. Their reasons are many, but women with unmet birth control needs have at least one thing in common: they don´t want to get pregnant but are not doing anything about it.

So the percentage of women with unmet needs in the least developed countries (21.4%) is almost double that of the global mean (11.5%), the UN reports.

#### Reasons

We are going to focus on those countries with the most difficult situations. What are the barriers for women to access contraceptives? According to the Guttmacher Institute's report  Unmet need for contraception in developing countries: examining women's reasons for not using a method, which analyzed 52 countries, the principal barriers are side effects, infrequent sex, and resistance by the woman or others. 

<div class="container-right">
  <div class="graph-container">

  </div>
</div>

The majority of respondents that do not use contraceptives for health reasons, or for fear of side effects, or because it affects natural bodily processes, have used some method at some point, according to the study. That is, they know what they are talking about: excess or reduced bleeding, nausea, changes in the body--weight gain or hair growth--loss of libido, mood changes... the long list of side effects of hormonal contraceptives does not help.

"It is necessary that there is much more progress and research. This is not enough, especially since many of the contraceptive methods focus only on women, while for men there are very few opportunities to be active in this sense", argues Mirjam Beck, a 27-year-old German. In 2016 the study of a male contraceptive [was stopped](http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2016/10/31/inyeccion-anticonceptiva-masculina-es-altamente-efectiva-pero-tiene-efectos-secundarios/) due to its side effects, very similar to those suffered by women today.

</div>

And there are also [reasons not based on scientific evidence](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2015/12/belief-family-planning-myths-individual-and-community-levels-and-modern), such as the claim that they might harm the ovaries, cause infertility, or even harm the male member.

The key, according to Alieu Jammeh, Reproductive Health Commodity Security Coordinator at UNFPA in Banjul, The Gambia, is the availability of variety, that their effects are well-explaiend to avoid bad unjustified bad reputations of some metods, and that each woman can decide which is best for her. This is the most important barrier across the analyzed countries.

Many women claim that they don't use contraceptives because they do not have sex on a regular basis. But sometimes they reply -in the very same survey- that they have had sexual encounters in the preceding month. In some countries, single women may not respond frankly about their sexual activity to avoid being singled out. For many of them, at least in public, sex and contraceptives are non-existent.

This refers to cultural reasons, in contrast to women's health-related barriers, such as the side effects of some hormonal contraceptives. Most of those who say this is the principal barrier have never used any method of birth control, according to the Guttmacher study. Somebody, whether it's the woman herself, her husband or others, is against her using birth control. But whom and why?

In most cases, the woman being interviewed says she is against birth control. Keeping in mind that we are only analyzing the responses of those women whose necessities are unmet--that is, they do not want more children but are not using birth control--everything points toward their response coming from many sources, from cultural to social to religious. 

Although the percentages are lower, religion can also affect opposition in the cases above. And the problem is not specific to any one religion: all the major ones impose barriers. In the most orthodox cases, it's the imam, priest, or rabbi who decides who uses, or doesn't use, birth control, and what type.

<div class="panel" markdown="1">

##### Husband or partner opposition

"Many women do not make independent decisions. They are made for them," says Fanta Jatta, of Action Aid International, in Banjul, The Gambia. She has known cases of women whose husbands began abusing them upon discovering they were taking the pill and others forced to carry pregnancies to term when it was a health risk. Momodou Njie of the Family Planning Association in Banjul, Gambia, tells stories of women who visit the clinic incognito and leave their paperwork there for fear of being discovered. "Men make most of the decisions, but in some cases the woman does it because she wants to save her life," he says.

In Albania, a country in which backing has a higher percentage of use, is also where the opposition of the husband is the main barrier to access. It is followed by East Timor, Mali, Senegal and Afghanistan.

The key is who makes the decision. For Alieu Jammeh, of the United Nations, it's important to include men in the decision to "minimize the friction" in the marriage. But, beyond that, "it's the woman's right to decide if she wants".

The mother-in-law, the father, or even medical or pharmacuetical services, among others, may intervene in the woman's decision. The Network for Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Mexico (DDESER) did a study of contraceptive distribution under two different governments. They interviewed managers, doctors, civil servants, and users. They even sent mystery shoppers posing as users. They found centers that refused to give condoms to youth, where the condoms piled up until they expired, or where they don't give the pill to married women, to give just two examples.

It's increasingly rare for women not to know about birth control methods, to lack access, or for them to cost too much. But in West and Central Africa, those reasons, "were mentioned by more than 10% of interviewed women," in the Guttmacher study. In Mexico, Patricia Ortega of DDSER says that there are "people who don't even know how to use a condom," at university.  When asked about how many times a condom can be used, 15.5% of the participants in the [Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey](http://ensanut.insp.mx/informes/ENSANUT2012ResultadosNacionales.pdf) responded incorrectly.

In The Gambia, television ads promoting contraceptive use were a social revolution a few years ago, and did not lack for critics in the Catholic community.

In Europe promotional campaigns for contraceptives have been rare for a while -with the exception of [those paid for by Durex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR4A-c23rsE)- and there is more and more public investment in promoting child-bearing. The Polish government ran a [campaign](https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/11/10/actualidad/1510327993_647673.html) encouraging its citizens to have sex and there is an [annual campaign in the Spanish region of Galicia](https://civio.es/el-boe-nuestro-de-cada-dia/2013/07/29/galicia-licita-por-640-000-euros-una-campana-para-animar-a-sus-ciudadanos-a-tener-hijos/) that appeals to the "necessary shared responsibility" of bringing more children into the world.

What does it mean for there to be unmet needs? That a woman cannot exercise her right to plan her own reproduction. According to the [WHO](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en/), family planning reduces abortions, especially dangerous ones, it reinforces the right to determine the number and timing of children, and prevents the deaths of both mothers and children.

In 2012, 85 million pregnancies worldwide [were unintended](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727534/). This is 40% of the total and many of them end in abortion - natural or voluntary. More data: an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, most of them in developing countries. With the risk that entails.

Some 830 women [die every day](http://www.who.int/maternal-health/en/) due to causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all are in developing countries. In fact, the WHO estimates that [in 2015 more](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/) than a third of those deaths occurred in Nigeria and India. Another way to put it is: if you live in a developed region your odds of dying in childbirth are 1 in 4.900. If you live in a developing country, they are 1 in 150.  

It's a question of public health, but above all of rights. Women have the right to freely choose if they want children, and how, and when.
